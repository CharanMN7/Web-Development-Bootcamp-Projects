<h1>Best Movies according to Charan</h1>

<h2>These are my top movie recommendations</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>
  This one's gotta be one of the best. It taught me a lot of things. <br />
  It's fun to watch too! Will Smith is great in this one.
</p>

<h3>Men in Black</h3>
<p>All three are good but can none beat the first one!</p>

<h3>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe</h3>
<p>Probably one of the very first movies that made me say, "Wooow! So beautiful!"</p>

<h3>Leap Year (2010)</h3>
<p>
  Such a beautiful love story! This one is probably the first movie I felt was a really beautiful
  love story<br />
  (Titanic was cool too but, this one's better)
